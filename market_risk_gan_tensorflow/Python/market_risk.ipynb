    "# Using Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks to estimate Value-at-Risk for Market Risk Management\n",
    "## Author: Hamaad Shah\n",

    "\n",
    "We will explore the use of Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks (BiGAN) for market risk management: Estimation of portfolio risk measures such as Value-at-Risk (VaR). Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) allow us to implicitly maximize the likelihood of complex distributions thereby allowing us to generate samples from such distributions - the key point here is the implicit maximum likelihood estimation principle whereby we do not specify what this complex distribution is parameterized as. Dealing with high dimensional data potentially coming from a complex distribution is a key aspect to market risk management among many other financial services use cases. GAN, specifically BiGAN for the purpose of this paper, will allow us to deal with potentially complex financial services data such that we do not have to explicitly specify a distribution such as a multidimensional Gaussian distribution.\n",

    "## Market Risk Management: Value-at-Risk (VaR)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "VaR is a measure of portfolio risk. For instance, a 1% VaR of -5% means that there is a 1% chance of earning a portfolio return of less than -5%. Think of it as a (lower) percentile or quantile of a portfolio returns distribution, i.e., we are concerned about the tail risk — the small chance of losing a remarkably large portfolio value. Such a large loss is funded by our own funds, i.e., capital which is an expensive source of funding compared to other peoples’ funds, i.e., debt. Therefore the estimation of VaR and similar market risk management measures inform banks and insurance firms with regards to the levels of capital they need to hold in order to have a buffer against unexpected downturns — market risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purpose, let us begin by fetching a data set of 5 stocks from Yahoo. The stocks are Apple, Google, Microsoft, Intel and Box. We use a daily frequency for our data for the year 2016. We use the stock's daily closing prices to compute the continuously compounded returns: $\\log\\left(\\frac{V_{t+1}}{V_{t}}\\right) = \\log(V_{t+1}) - \\log(V_{t})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../R/portfolio_returns.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's estimate the expected returns vector, volatilities vector, correlation and variance-covariance matrices. The variance-covariance matrix is recovered from the estimated volatilities vector and correlation matrix: $\\Omega = C \\odot \\sigma \\sigma^{T}$ where $\\odot$ is the Hadamard product, $C \\in \\mathbb{R}^{5 \\times 5}$ and $\\sigma \\in \\mathbb{R}^{5 \\times 1}$. Portfolio volatility is estimated as: $w^{T}\\Omega w$ where $w \\in \\mathbb{R}^{5 \\times 1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider the 3 major methods used in market risk management, specifically for the estimation of VaR. Please note that there are multiple different methods for estimating VaR and other more coherent risk measures such as Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) however we are only considering the few major ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "## VaR: Variance-covariance method\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The first one is the variance-covariance method and uses the estimated portfolio volatility $w^{T}\\Omega w$ under the Gaussian assumption to estimate VaR. Let's assume we are attempting to estimate 1% VaR: This means that there is a 1% probability of obtaining a portfolio return of less than the VaR value. Using the variance-covariance approach the calculation is: $\\left[\\left(w^{T}\\Omega w\\right) \\mathcal{N}^{-1}(1\\%)\\right] + w^{T}\\mu$, where $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}^{5 \\times 1}$ is the expected returns vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "## VaR: Historical simulation method\n",
    "The second method is a non-parametric approach where we sample with replacement from the historical data to estimate a portfolio returns distribution. The 1% VaR is simply the appropriate quantile from this sampled portfolio returns distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## VaR: Monte Carlo method\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The third method is Monte Carlo sampling from a multidimensional Gaussian distribution using the aforementioned $mu$ and $\\Omega$ parameters. Finally the 1% VaR is simply the appropriate quantile from this sampled portfolio returns distribution.\n",

    "The 2 main components to a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) are the generator and the discriminator. These 2 components play an adversarial game against each other. In doing so the generator learns how to create realistic synthetic samples from noise, i.e., the latent space $z$, while the discriminator learns how to distinguish between a real sample and a synthetic sample. See the following article of mine for a detailed explanation of GAN: https://goo.gl/ZWYngw\n",

    "Contrast this with a trained BiGAN: The following graph will clearly show the value of GAN type models for market risk management as we have arrived at this learnt portfolio returns distribution without having to rely on a possibly incorrect assumption with regards to the actual portfolio returns distribution such as a multidimensional Gaussian distribution.\n",

    "Finally we update the VaR estimate table for using different market risk management methods as below. We can see that the VaR estimate provided by the BiGAN is similar, if not exactly the same, to the ones provided by the other market risk management methods. This provides us with a good sanity check with regards to using the BiGAN for market risk management in that it provides competitive results with respect to well established existing market risk management methods.\n",

    "The portfolio of 5 stocks we had to work with was not particularly complicated compared to potentially having portfolios where we might have derivatives or other portfolio components. Arriving at the correct portfolio returns distribution of a potentially complicated portfolio is a problem that has been shown can be solved via deep learning specifically the BiGAN. This result can be useful for market risk management and any other different problem space where we need to generate samples from a potentially complex, and perhaps unknown, distribution. \n",

    "There will potentially be a follow up article of mine where we look at a complicated backtesting scenario, i.e., validating that market risk management VaR type estimates provided by BiGAN is appropriate for future portfolio returns distributions that we have not seen, and perhaps using more complicated portfolios. The aim of this article of mine was to clearly show that a trained BiGAN can be used for market risk management VaR estimation for a given portfolio."
